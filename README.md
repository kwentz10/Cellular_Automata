# Cellular_Automata

I replicated the raster non-oriented tea leaf dispersion model and the regolith formation model from Tucker et al. 2016 paper.

I also tried to mix things up and model hexagonal oriented tea leaf dispersion, but I get the error (after it does 1 iteration): 
ValueError: Can not reset the axes.  You are probably trying to re-use an artist in more than one Axes which is not supported

Not sure what is going on...
